However, it's important to note that gross margin might not be the most useful metric for a financial services company like American Express. \n\nGross margin is typically used in industries that sell physical goods, as it measures the difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold (COGS). In the case of American Express, which is a financial services company, they don't sell physical goods, so they don't have a traditional COGS. \n\nInstead, financial services companies typically focus on metrics such as net interest income, non-interest income, and provisions for credit losses. These metrics provide a more accurate picture of a financial institution's profitability and financial health. For example, in the case of American Express, we can see that their total revenues net of interest expense increased from $42,380 million in 2021 to $52,862 million in 2022. Similarly, their net income decreased from $8,060 million in 2021 to $7,514 million in 2022.

However, it's important to note that gross margin is not typically a relevant or commonly used metric for financial services companies like JPMorgan Chase. This is because gross margin is calculated as sales revenue minus cost of goods sold, divided by sales revenue. For companies in the manufacturing or retail sectors, this is a straightforward calculation. However, banks and financial institutions do not sell physical goods, so they don't have a \"cost of goods sold\" in the traditional sense. Instead, financial institutions have net interest income, which is the difference between the revenue generated from a bank's assets and the expenses associated with paying out its liabilities. They also have non-interest income from fees, services, and other sources. Therefore, metrics such as net interest margin, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE) are more commonly used to evaluate the performance and profitability of banks and financial institutions.","label":"Correct Answer"}

If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"Performance is not measured through operating margin","model_answer":"The document provided does not directly provide information on the operating margin for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. Operating margin is calculated as operating income (or earnings before interest and taxes - EBIT) divided by total revenue, and it measures a company's profitability and how well it controls its costs.\n\nHowever, we can infer some information from the data provided. The total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses have increased each year from 2020 to 2022, and the total expenses have also increased each year. If we assume these figures roughly correspond to revenue and operating expenses, it appears that both are increasing. \n\nWithout exact figures, it's hard to say definitively whether the operating margin is improving. If the rate of increase in revenue is higher than the rate of increase in expenses, then the operating margin would be improving. However, if expenses are growing at a faster rate than revenue, the operating margin would be declining.\n\nFor a financial institution like AMEX, operating margin can be a useful metric as it provides insight into how efficiently the company is being run. However, it's also important to consider other factors such as interest income and expense, provisions for credit losses, and the nature of the company's revenues and expenses, which can be influenced by factors such as interest rates and credit risk.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, then please state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"Yes. American Water Works had postivie working capital of $ 124Mn by FY 2022.","model_answer":"Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. Based on the FY2022 data provided, American Water Works Company has current assets of $1,250 million and current liabilities of $2,811 million. \n\nTherefore, the working capital for FY2022 is $1,250 million - $2,811 million = -$1,561 million. \n\nThis indicates that American Water Works Company has negative working capital for FY2022. This could suggest that the company may have trouble meeting its short-term obligations. However, it's important to note that this is just one financial metric and doesn't necessarily indicate financial distress.

If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022.","model_answer":"The gross margin profile for Boeing does not appear to be improving as of FY2022. Gross margin is calculated as total revenues minus the cost of goods sold (in this case, the cost of products and services), divided by total revenues. \n\nIn 2020, the gross margin was negative due to the cost of products and services exceeding total revenues. In 2021, the gross margin improved but was still relatively low. In 2022, the gross margin decreased again, indicating a worsening profile.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that gross margin may not be the most useful metric for a company like Boeing. This is because Boeing operates in the aerospace industry, which is characterized by high fixed costs and long product development cycles. The cost of producing aircraft is extremely high, and these costs are often incurred long before revenues are realized. Therefore, a low or negative gross margin in a given year does not necessarily indicate poor performance, but could reflect investments in future growth. \n\nMoreover, Boeing's financials have been significantly impacted by specific issues such as the grounding of the 737 Max and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry. These factors have led to increased costs and reduced revenues, negatively impacting the gross margin. Therefore, other metrics such as operating margin or net margin might provide a more accurate picture of Boeing's financial health.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}
