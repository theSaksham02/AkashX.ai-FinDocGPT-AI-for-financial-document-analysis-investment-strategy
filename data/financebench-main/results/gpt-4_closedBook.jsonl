These metrics provide a more accurate picture of the company's financial health and profitability. \n\nNet interest margin, for example, measures the difference between the interest income generated by the company and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders, relative to the amount of their interest-earning assets. Return on equity measures a corporation's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. Efficiency ratio is used to analyze how well a company uses its assets and liabilities internally. \n\nAs of FY2022, any changes in these metrics for American Express would be driven by factors such as changes in interest rates, credit losses, operating expenses, and the volume of transactions processed by the company.","label":"Refusal"}
