It is calculated by dividing a company's quick assets (cash, accounts receivable, and inventory) by its current liabilities.\n\nBased on the information provided in the consolidated interim financial statements, AMCOR's quick ratio has declined between FY2023 and FY2022.

In 2021, the company's gross margin increased to 60.3% from 59.3% in 2020, driven by favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and the gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in many markets throughout 2021. Additionally, the company's gross margin percentage increased by 5 percentage points in 2021 compared to the previous year, driven by higher sales in all segments and lower charges for severance and capacity realignment costs, partially offset by increased expenses due to elevated freight, logistics, and raw material costs.\n\nIt's worth noting that the company's gross margin percentage has fluctuated over the years, with a high of 43.7% in 2018 and a low of 37.6% in 2013.

Additionally, the operating income for FY2015 is $39,032 ($25,942 + $158 + $10,658 + $2,274).\n\nTo calculate the D&A % margin, we need to first calculate the total depreciation and amortization expense for FY2015. We can do this by adding the accumulated depreciation and amortization at the beginning and end of the period:\n\nTotal D&A expense = Accumulated D&A at beginning of period + Accumulated D&A at end of period - Accumulated D&A at beginning of period\n\nTotal D&A expense = $94,351 + $102,211 - $98,199 = $108,363\n\nNow, we can calculate the D&A % margin as follows:\n\nD&A % margin = Total D&A expense \/ Operating Income\n= $108,363 \/ $39,032\n= 27.7%\n\nTherefore, the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A from cash flow statement) % margin for AMD is 27.7%.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition","model_answer":" Based on the information provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the driving factors behind the operating margin change for AMD as of FY22 are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer some possible reasons based on the information available.\n\nFirstly, AMD launched several new high-performance products in 2017, including its first-generation Ryzen desktop CPUs based on the new \"Zen\" x86 CPU core architecture. This product launch could have had a positive impact on AMD's revenue and operating margin, as it likely generated increased sales and customer acceptance.\n\nSecondly, AMD's technology competitiveness improved with the launch of these new products, which could have helped the company to better compete in the market and potentially increase its prices and profitability.\n\nThirdly, AMD's receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent on the success of third-party products that incorporate its technology. Therefore, if these third-party products are successful, it could positively impact AMD's revenue and operating margin.\n\nLastly, global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMD's business and operating results, but it is unclear how significant this impact was in FY22.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that operating margin may not be a useful metric for a company like AMD, as it primarily offers x86 microprocessors, GPUs, and other semiconductor products. The profitability of these products can vary greatly depending on factors such as production costs, competition, and market demand, which may make it challenging to assess the company's financial performance using a single metric like operating margin.

However, during this time of increased investments, AMEX has shifted its financial priorities to focus primarily on growth, balanced by the long-term health of the company, including returns. This suggests that the company may have sacrificed some short-term profitability in order to invest in its future growth.\n\nFurthermore, the company's net income was reported to be $7.5 billion in 2022, compared to $8.1 billion in the previous year, reflecting credit reserve builds and net losses in its Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio.

Round answer to two decimal places.","gold_answer":0.54,"model_answer":" Sure! To calculate the FY2022 retention ratio for General Mills using total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the total cash dividends paid in FY2022:\nFrom the income statement, we see that the dividends per share were $1.96 in FY2022. Let's assume there were no changes in the number of shares outstanding during the year (this is a simplifying assumption). Then, we can calculate the total cash dividends paid as follows:\n\nTotal cash dividends paid = Dividends per share x Number of shares outstanding\n= $1.96 x 2,735.0 million shares (from the previous year's balance sheet)\n= $5,384.6 million\n2. Next, find the net income attributable to shareholders in FY2022:\nFrom the income statement, we see that the net earnings attributable to General Mills were $2,181.2 million in FY2022.\n3. Now, calculate the retention ratio:\nThe retention ratio is the percentage of net income attributable to shareholders that is not distributed as dividends. We can calculate it as follows:\n\nRetention ratio = (Net income attributable to shareholders - Total cash dividends paid) \/ Net income attributable to shareholders\n= ($2,181.2 million - $5,384.6 million) \/ $2,181.2 million\n= 0.75 or 75%\n\nSo, the FY2022 retention ratio for General Mills using total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders is 75%. This means that General Mills retained 75% of its net income attributable to shareholders in FY2022, rather than distributing it all as dividends.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

Please help us compute it by basing your answers off of the statement of income and the statement of cash flows. Here's the question: what is the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix? Calculate unadjusted EBITDA using unadjusted operating income and D&A (from cash flow statement).","gold_answer":0.054,"model_answer":" Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nTo calculate the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix, we will need to refer to the statement of income and the statement of cash flows.\n\nFirst, let's calculate unadjusted operating income:\n\nUnadjusted operating income = Operating income - (Impact of currency on net sales)\n\nAccording to the statement of income, the operating income for FY2015 was $1,752.7 million. There is no mention of any impact of currency on net sales, so we can assume that there was no significant impact from currency fluctuations. Therefore, unadjusted operating income would be the same as operating income, which is $1,752.7 million.\n\nNext, let's calculate depreciation and amortization (D&A):\n\nDepreciation and amortization (D&A) = Depreciation + Amortization\n\nAccording to the statement of cash flows, the depreciation expense for FY2015 was $367.8 million. The amortization expense is not explicitly stated in the provided information, but it can be inferred from the adjusted EBITDA reconciliation. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income\/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense\/(income), provision for\/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding restructuring activities). Based on this definition, we can deduce that the amortization expense for FY2015 was $49.0 million. Therefore, D&A would be $367.8 million + $49.0 million = $416.8 million.\n\nNow, let's calculate unadjusted EBITDA:\n\nUnadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted operating income + D&A\n\nSubstituting the values we have obtained, we get:\n\nUnadjusted EBITDA = $1,752.7 million + $416.8 million = $2,169.5 million\n\nFinally, we can calculate the unadjusted EBITDA % margin:\n\nUnadjusted EBITDA % margin = Unadjusted EBITDA \/ Net sales\n\nAccording to the statement of income, the net sales for FY2015 were $20,557.8 million. Therefore, the unadjusted EBITDA % margin would be:\n\nUnadjusted EBITDA % margin = $2,169.5 million \/ $20,557.8 million = 10.5%\n\nTherefore, the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix is 10.5%.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

Therefore, the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2016 was:\n\nCost of goods sold ($14,067 million) \/ Revenue ($34,797 million) = 0.406 or 40.6%\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, Nike's cost of goods sold was $15,377 million, and its revenue was $36,279 million. Therefore, the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2017 was:\n\nCost of goods sold ($15,377 million) \/ Revenue ($36,279 million) = 0.423 or 42.3%\n\nIn fiscal year 2018, Nike's cost of goods sold was $16,404 million, and its revenue was $38,187 million.

If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"No. The quick ratio was approximately 0.54 for Verizon. It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.","model_answer":" Based on the information provided in Note 7C, Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources, Verizon's quick ratio, which is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, was 1.35:1 as of December 31, 2022. This indicates that Verizon has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile, as it has more than enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. A quick ratio of 1:1 or higher is generally considered good, so Verizon's ratio of 1.35:1 suggests that it has a comfortable level of liquidity.\n\nIt's worth noting that the quick ratio is just one measure of liquidity, and it may not be the most relevant metric for every situation. For example, if a company has a large portion of its current assets tied up in illiquid inventory or other non-cash assets, the quick ratio might not accurately reflect its true liquidity position.
