The remainder of the change in value is recorded in earnings.\n\n- Recognition in earnings of amounts previously in cumulative translation is limited to circumstances like complete liquidation of the hedged foreign operation. \n\n- If foreign currency debt is not designated as a net investment hedge, changes in value due to exchange rates are recorded in earnings through maturity.\n\n- 3M's use of forward contracts for net investment hedging varies based on when foreign currency debt is dedesignated, matures, or is newly issued and designated. It also varies based on the extent of desired foreign exchange risk coverage.\n\n- In Q1 2018, 3M dedesignated 300 million Euros of foreign currency debt from a former net investment hedge. \n\n- At Dec 31, 2018, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as net investment hedges was approximately 150 million Euros and 248 billion South Korean Won, plus 4.1 billion Euros of long-term debt instruments. The maturity dates range from 2019 to 2031.\n\n- Gains\/losses related to instruments designated as net investment hedges are recorded in the income statement and comprehensive income, but there were no reclassifications out of accumulated OCI into income for the periods presented.\n\nDoes this help summarize the key points relating to 3M's use of derivatives for net investment hedging?

Answer the following question by primarily using information that is shown in the balance sheet: what is the year end FY2018 net PPNE for 3M? Answer in USD billions.","gold_answer":8.7,"model_answer":" Here are the key points I gathered from the financial statement notes regarding derivatives:\n\n- 3M uses various types of derivatives, including interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts, to manage risks associated with interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. \n\n- For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, gains\/losses are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. For fair value hedges, gains\/losses on the derivatives offset gains\/losses on the hedged items in earnings. \n\n- As of December 31, 2018, 3M had $64 million (after tax) of unrealized gains associated with cash flow hedging instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income. This is expected to be reclassified to earnings in 2019-2020 as the hedged transactions occur.\n\n- 3M uses interest rate swaps as fair value hedges to manage exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of these swaps was $2.4 billion.\n\n- 3M uses foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt to hedge portions of its net investment in foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of these instruments was approximately 4.5 billion Euros and 248 billion South Korean Won.\n\n- Derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Gains\/losses on derivatives flow through the income statement and\/or other comprehensive income, depending on their hedge designation. This impacts earnings and equity.\n\nIn summary, 3M uses derivatives principally to manage various market risks and not for speculative purposes. The notes provide details on the types of derivatives used and their accounting treatment.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

Respirator mask\/asbestos litigation - Lawsuits alleging injuries from use of 3M respirator masks. In July 2022, 3M's Aearo subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy to establish a trust to resolve these claims. \n\n2. Environmental litigation - Lawsuits and regulatory actions related to alleged PFAS contamination from 3M's manufacturing sites. This includes a major case regarding 3M's Zwijndrecht plant in Belgium. \n\n3. AFFF litigation - Thousands of lawsuits alleging environmental and personal injury damages from 3M's aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) products containing PFAS.

If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges","model_answer":" Based on the 10-K filing, here are the key points about what drove operating margin change for 3M in FY2022:\n\n- Net sales decreased 3.2% year-over-year to $34.2 billion in FY2022, due to lower demand in several end markets and the impact of divestitures. \n\n- Operating income margin decreased to 19.1% in FY2022 from 20.8% in FY2021.\n\n- The operating margin decrease was primarily driven by:\n\n1) Higher costs for significant litigation, which reduced operating margin by 1.4 percentage points. This included charges related to resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and addressing PFAS matters at the Zwijndrecht site. \n\n2) Higher raw material and logistics costs, which reduced operating margin by 2.4 percentage points. 3M continued to experience inflationary pressures on costs in 2022.\n\n3) Divestiture impacts, including lost income from divested businesses, which reduced operating margin. This includes the impact of the split-off of the Food Safety business.\n\n4) These decreases were partially offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements, which increased operating margin.\n\nSo in summary, the operating margin decline was driven largely by higher litigation costs, raw material\/logistics inflation, and divestiture impacts, partially offset by pricing actions and productivity.","label":"Correct Answer"}

This marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.\n\n- In May 2023, the Board declared a second quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, unchanged from the first quarter. \n\n- The filing does not indicate any plans to suspend, reduce or eliminate the dividend in the foreseeable future. \n\n- The consistent dividend increases over many decades and the recent dividend declarations in 2023 suggest 3M is likely to maintain a stable trend of dividend distributions going forward.\n\nIn summary, the information provided in the 10-Q filing indicates 3M has a very consistent history of dividend payments and increases, with no signs of deviating from that trend based on the dividends declared so far in 2023.

If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark","model_answer":" Here are the key points regarding 3M's liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 2023:\n\n- 3M's quick ratio for Q2 2023 was 1.44. The quick ratio measures a company's ability to use its most liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable) to meet its current liabilities. \n\n- A quick ratio of 1.44 means 3M has $1.44 of liquid assets available to cover each $1 of current liabilities. This indicates a reasonably healthy liquidity position.\n\n- Quick ratios between 1 and 1.5 are generally considered good for most industries. 3M's quick ratio falls within this range, suggesting it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its short-term obligations.\n\n- The quick ratio only considers cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable in assessing liquidity. It does not take into account other liquid asset sources 3M may have access to, such as unused credit facilities. This suggests 3M may have even more liquidity than the quick ratio indicates.\n\n- Overall, 3M's quick ratio of 1.44 for Q2 2023 indicates the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile and should be able to meet its current liabilities as they come due, based on this metric. The quick ratio is relevant for assessing 3M's short-term liquidity position.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

{"financebench_id":"financebench_id_00438","model_name":"claude-2","eval_mode":"inContext","temp":0.01,"question":"Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.","model_answer":" Here is a summary of Adobe's operating margin profile based on its 2022 financial filing:\n\n- Adobe reported total revenue of $17.6 billion in fiscal year 2022, up 12% from $15.8 billion in 2021. \n\n- Its gross margin was 88% in 2022, unchanged from 2021. This indicates that Adobe continues to maintain strong gross margins on its software subscriptions and services.\n\n- Operating expenses were $9.3 billion in 2022, up 15% from $8.1 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation costs and increased marketing spending. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 53% in 2022 compared to 51% in 2021.\n\n- As a result, Adobe's operating income grew to $6.1 billion in 2022, up 5% from $5.8 billion in 2021. The operating margin declined to 35% in 2022 from 37% in 2021.\n\nIn summary, Adobe's operating margin profile declined slightly in 2022 compared to 2021, driven primarily by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The company continues to maintain high gross margins on its software subscriptions, but is investing more in compensation, marketing and other operating costs to drive future revenue growth. The operating margin decline was modest and Adobe's profitability remains strong overall. Barring a significant ramp up in operating expenses, the operating margin profile appears stable going into 2023.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

This boosted free cash flow as these expenses don't impact cash flows.\n\n2) Working capital improvements, with higher growth in deferred revenue compared to accounts receivable. This freed up more cash for Adobe.\n\n3) Lower cash taxes paid in FY2022 compared to FY2021.\n\nSo in summary, yes Adobe has shown an improving free cash flow conversion in FY2022 compared to FY2021, driven by higher non-cash expenses, working capital improvements, and lower cash taxes. The higher free cash flow conversion rate demonstrates Adobe's ability to translate its earnings into cash at a higher rate.","label":"Correct Answer"}

This should support improved mix and margins over time.\n\n- The company is also focused on sustainability, innovation, and differentiated packaging, which allows Amcor to enhance margins through proprietary designs and technologies.\n\nIn summary, Amcor's gross margin profile continues to improve in FY2023 despite near-term headwinds. The company is well-positioned competitively and is taking actions to expand margins further in FY2024 and over the long-term through its strategy.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

{"financebench_id":"financebench_id_00917","model_name":"claude-2","eval_mode":"inContext","temp":0.01,"question":"What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition","model_answer":" Here is a summary of the key points regarding AMD's operating margin change in FY22:\n\n- AMD's operating margin declined from 22% in FY21 to 5% in FY22. There are a few main factors driving this decline:\n\n1. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - With the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando in 2022, AMD recorded significant intangible assets like developed technology, customer relationships, and trademarks on its balance sheet. The amortization expense for these intangibles was $3.5 billion in FY22, which weighed heavily on operating margin. \n\n2. Higher operating expenses - AMD's operating expenses grew significantly in FY22 driven by the additional headcount and go-to-market activities from the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions. R&D expenses were up 76% and MG&A expenses were up 61% year-over-year. The incremental spending on future growth reduced current period operating margin.\n\n3. Client segment decline - AMD's Client segment revenue declined 10% in FY22 due to weak PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. This impacted operating leverage, as operating expenses continued to grow while Client revenue declined. The Client segment operating margin was 19% in FY22, down from 30% in FY21.\n\n4. Inventory charges - AMD recorded inventory valuation charges in Q3 2022, primarily related to its Client and Gaming segments. This was driven by the weak PC market conditions and lower gaming graphics demand. The charges negatively impacted gross margin and operating margin.\n\nIn summary, the significant decline in AMD's operating margin from FY21 to FY22 was primarily attributable to the amortization of intangibles from the Xilinx and Pensando deals, higher operating expenses from the acquisitions, weaker Client segment profitability, and inventory charges. The investments AMD is making in R&D and future growth led to lower operating leverage in the current period.","label":"Correct Answer"}

This cash inflow was driven primarily by:\n\n1) AMD's net income of $1.3 billion in 2022, adjusted for $4.1 billion of non-cash expenses like depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. \n\n2) These positive cash flows were partially offset by $1.8 billion of net cash outflows from changes in AMD's operating assets and liabilities. The main drivers here were:\n\n- A $1.4 billion increase in inventories to build advanced process nodes and support new product ramps. \n\n- A $1.1 billion increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenue. \n\n- A $1.2 billion increase in prepaid expenses for long-term supply agreements.\n\n- These were partially offset by a $931 million increase in accounts payable from timing of payments and a $546 million increase in accrued liabilities.\n\nIn summary, AMD generated strong operating cash flow of $3.6 billion in 2022, driven by net income adjusted for non-cash items.

{"financebench_id":"financebench_id_00222","model_name":"claude-2","eval_mode":"inContext","temp":0.01,"question":"Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)\/ (current liabilities).","model_answer":" Here is a summary of my responses to your questions:\n\n1. Based on AMD's quick ratio of 1.9 for FY22, it appears AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile. The quick ratio measures a company's ability to use its most liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable) to meet its current liabilities. A ratio of 1.9 means AMD has $1.90 of liquid assets available for every $1 of current liabilities, which is considered a good level for most companies. This indicates AMD should have sufficient liquidity to manage its short-term cash needs and meet its near-term obligations. \n\nSome key points on AMD's liquidity:\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents increased significantly from $2.5 billion at end of 2021 to $4.8 billion at end of 2022, providing a healthy cash buffer. \n\n- Accounts receivable also increased in 2022, but this appears in line with AMD's revenue growth. Receivables have not risen disproportionately compared to sales.\n\n- AMD has access to additional liquidity through its new $3 billion revolving credit facility if needed. \n\n- AMD's current ratio, which includes inventory and other current assets, is also healthy at 2.4x. \n\n- AMD is generating strong operating cash flows, with $3.6 billion generated in 2022.\n\nSo in summary, the quick ratio of 1.9x, in the context of AMD's overall liquidity position, indicates they have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile to meet short-term needs. The quick ratio is a relevant metric for assessing their liquidity. Other liquidity ratios like the current ratio and cash flow also support this assessment.\n\n2. I do not see any reason why the quick ratio would not be relevant for evaluating AMD's liquidity profile. The quick ratio focuses specifically on a company's most liquid assets, which is important for assessing short-term liquidity. While no single metric can provide a complete picture, the quick ratio is a commonly used and useful measure for evaluating a company's ability to cover its near-term obligations with its most liquid resources. AMD's quick ratio, in conjunction with their current ratio, cash flows, and overall financial position, helps provide a comprehensive liquidity assessment. The quick ratio appears to be an appropriate metric for AMD based on their financial statements and no information indicates it would not be relevant in their situation.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

Their main revenue sources are discount revenue (fees charged to merchants), interest income, net card fees, and service fees\/other revenue. \n\n- Gross margin is not a commonly reported metric or key performance indicator for financial services firms like American Express. As a payments company, their key metrics are more focused on transaction volumes, number of cards issued, interest income, and expenses.\n\n- Looking at their financial performance in FY2022 vs FY2021:\n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25% to $52.9 billion, driven by growth across all revenue lines: discount revenue (+25%), net card fees (+17%), service\/other revenue (+36%), interest income (+40%). This revenue growth reflects the recovery in consumer\/business spending and card loan balances from pandemic lows.\n\nProvisions for credit losses swung from a benefit of $1.4 billion in 2021 to an expense of $2.2 billion in 2022, as credit metrics normalized from unusually low levels during the pandemic.\n\nTotal expenses increased 24% to $41.1 billion, driven by higher customer engagement costs, operating expenses, and marketing investments. \n\nPretax income declined 10% to $9.6 billion, due to the credit loss provision swing noted above. \n\nNet income declined 7% to $7.5 billion, primarily due to the pretax income decline.\n\nIn summary, American Express showed strong revenue growth in 2022 as spending volumes recovered, but profitability was impacted by normalization of credit provisions and higher investments\/expenses.

Compute or extract the answer by primarily using the details outlined in the statement of cash flows.","gold_answer":0.4,"model_answer":" Here are some key points about regulatory liabilities from the passage:\n\n- Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts recovered from customers in advance of incurring the costs. \n\n- Approximately 40% of the total regulatory liability balance at December 31, 2020 represents amounts that have been collected from customers but have not yet been spent to provide utility service.\n\n- Major components include deferred income taxes, cost of removal obligations, and revenue subject to refund. \n\n- Deferred income taxes result from changes in tax laws or rates, including excess accumulated deferred income taxes (EADIT) that have been collected from customers but have not yet been returned. \n\n- Cost of removal obligations represent amounts previously recovered through depreciation rates for future asset removal costs.\n\n- Revenue subject to refund includes amounts collected from customers pending the outcome of general rate cases or other regulatory proceedings.\n\nSo in summary, regulatory liabilities represent amounts owed to customers that have either been collected in advance or in excess of costs incurred. The company records these as liabilities since they will need to be refunded or credited to customers in future rates. The largest components relate to deferred taxes and removal costs recovered through depreciation.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, then please state that and explain why.","gold_answer":"Yes. American Water Works had postivie working capital of $ 124Mn by FY 2022.","model_answer":" Based on the information provided in the American Water Works Company 2022 10-K filing, here are the key points:\n\n- American Water Works has positive working capital based on FY2022 data. \n\n- Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. Based on the consolidated balance sheets, American Water Works had current assets of $1,250 million and current liabilities of $2,811 million as of December 31, 2022. This results in negative working capital of ($1,561) million.\n\n- However, working capital is not a particularly useful or relevant metric for American Water Works as a regulated utility company. Regulated utilities generally have negative working capital because they use short-term debt, like commercial paper, to fund long-term assets needed to provide service. The negative working capital reflects the timing difference between when costs are incurred versus when they can be recovered through customer rates. \n\n- More relevant metrics for American Water Works are cash flows from operations, capital expenditures to maintain\/improve infrastructure, ability to access capital markets to fund investments, and regulatory support. On these metrics:\n\n- Cash flows from operations were $1.1 billion in 2022.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $2.3 billion in 2022, largely to improve infrastructure. \n\n- The company accessed capital markets, issuing $800 million in long-term debt in 2022. \n\n- Regulators continue to allow recovery of costs and investments through customer rates.\n\nSo in summary, while American Water Works has negative working capital based on the balance sheet data, this is not unusual for a regulated utility. More important metrics related to cash flow, infrastructure investment, capital market access and regulation show the company is performing well.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

The International segment, which includes all Canada operations, generated $3.5 billion in revenue.\n\n- In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, Best Buy reports total cash provided by operating activities of $1.8 billion in FY2023. However, it does not break out operating cash flows specifically by segment.\n\n- Based on the relative revenue levels, it can be inferred that the Domestic segment likely generated the majority of the operating cash flow compared to the smaller International segment. \n\n- In addition, in the MD&A, Best Buy states that the decreases in revenue, gross profit rate, SG&A and operating income rate in FY2023 were primarily driven by the Domestic segment. This further implies that the Domestic segment is the larger contributor to operating cash flows.\n\nIn summary, while not specifically disclosed, the Domestic segment likely generated significantly more operating cash flow than the International segment in FY2023 based on its much larger revenue base and its primary contribution to Best Buy's overall operating income and cash flows. Therefore, the Domestic segment likely brought in the most operating cash flow in FY2023.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

These categories are Commercial Airplanes which comprises 39% of total revenue, Defence which comprises 35% of total revenue and Services which comprises 26% of total revenue.","model_answer":" Here are the key points regarding the deferral elections under The Boeing Company Executive Supplemental Savings Plan:\n\n- Eligible employees can make two types of deferral elections - Extra Deferrals and Restoration Deferrals. \n\n- Extra Deferrals allow eligible employees to defer up to 50% of base salary, 100% of cash incentives, and 100% of vested performance awards. These deferrals are made without regard to the 401(a)(17) and 415(c) limitations.\n\n- Restoration Deferrals allow eligible employees to defer up to the maximum percentage they can elect to contribute to the 401(k) plan. Restoration Deferrals are made only after base salary reaches the 401(a)(17) limit or 401(k) contributions reach the 415(c) limit. \n\n- Annual deferral elections are generally made during the annual election period, which is prior to the beginning of each plan year.\n\n- Eligible new hires can make mid-year deferral elections within 30 days of becoming eligible. Mid-year elections apply prospectively to compensation earned after the end of the election period.\n\n- Deferral elections become irrevocable at the end of the election period. Participants cannot change or terminate their deferral elections during the plan year except in limited circumstances involving an unforeseeable emergency.\n\n- Deferred amounts are credited to the participant's account and earn investment returns based on the participant's investment elections. \n\n- The timing and form of distribution are elected by the participant at the time of deferral. Distributions are made after separation from service or at a specified date.\n\nIn summary, the plan allows eligible employees to defer compensation on a pre-tax basis and provides flexibility in payout timing. Deferral elections are made prospectively and become irrevocable to comply with 409A requirements.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

This is intended to promote optimal risk and return.\n\n- For 2023, Coca-Cola expects net periodic pension cost of approximately $40 million compared to net periodic pension income of $124 million in 2022.

Diluted EPS was down 49% in 2020 compared to $1.07 in 2019.\n\n- The increase in net income and EPS in 2021 was driven by higher sales volumes across all segments, lower restructuring and impairment charges, gains on translated earnings contracts, and higher translation gains on debt. This was partially offset by the absence of a prior year gain on an equity investment.\n\n- Segment sales were up in all segments in 2021, led by Optical Communications up 22%, Life Sciences up 24%, Display Technologies up 17%, Environmental Technologies up 16%, and Specialty Materials up 7%.\n\nSo in summary, Corning saw a rebound in 2021 with higher sales, earnings, and margins compared to 2020, which was impacted by the pandemic.

This represents a relatively small portion (3.8%) of total revenues, suggesting the business is not particularly capital intensive overall.\n\n- The cash flow statement shows capital expenditures of $2.7 billion in FY2022. Again, this is a fairly modest amount (less than 1% of revenues) for capital spending. \n\n- The business segments include pharmacy services, health care benefits, and retail\/LTC pharmacy operations. These seem to be service-oriented businesses that are less capital intensive than traditional manufacturing or commodity industries.\n\n- Notes to the financial statements do not indicate any major capital projects or expansions underway. The company even closed over 300 retail stores in 2022 as part of optimizing its network.\n\nIn summary, while CVS Health is a large company that has made substantial investments over time, the actual capital spending and capital assets appear modest relative to the overall revenues and scale of the business. The service-oriented nature of the operations also suggests it is not a highly capital intensive business model. Therefore, I would conclude that CVS Health does not appear to be a capital-intensive business based on the FY2022 financial data provided.

The issuance of preference stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of Common Stock and \ncould delay, defer or prevent a change in control.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Effects\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and of Delaware corporate law could have the effect of \ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of General Mills or removal of existing management and may adversely affect \nthe voting and other rights of the holders of Common Stock. These provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage certain \ntypes of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of General \nMills to negotiate first with our Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or \nunsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure General Mills outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging such proposals because, \namong other things, negotiation of such proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Statute. We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover statute. In general, Section 203 \nprohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a \nperiod of three years following the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless: (a) prior to such time, the board of \ndirectors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an \ninterested stockholder; (b) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, \nthe interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced (excluding \nfor purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) \nthe voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a \nconfidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan); or (c) on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved \nby the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds \nof the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder. Generally, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d \nincludes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an \n\u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years prior to the determination \nof interested stockholder status did own) 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting stock. The existence of this provision would be \nexpected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board of Directors, including \ndiscouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of Common Stock held by stockholders.\nClassified Board. Our Certificate of Incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes. The directors in each \nclass serve for a three-year term, one class being elected each year by our stockholders. This system of electing and removing directors \nmay discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us because the classification of \nthe Board of Directors generally makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors.\nRemoval of Directors. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that directors may be removed from office only for cause and \nonly by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock \nentitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nStockholder Action. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that any action required or permitted to be taken by our \nstockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting rather than by written consent.\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders. Our By-laws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our \nChairman of the Board, our Chief Executive Officer or our Board of Directors. Stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting \nor to require our Board of Directors to call a special meeting.\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our By-laws contain advance notice \nprocedures with regard to stockholder proposals related to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be \nbrought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals related to stockholder \nnominations for the election of directors or new business must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor \nmore than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year. The notice must contain certain \ninformation concerning the persons to be nominated or the matters to be brought before the meeting and concerning the stockholders \nmaking the nominations or proposal.\n\n2\n\nLimitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nThe DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders \nfor monetary damages for breaches of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties as directors and our Certificate of Incorporation includes such an \nexculpation provision. Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws include provisions that indemnify, to the fullest extent allowable \nunder the DGCL, the personal liability of directors or officers for monetary damages for actions taken as a director or officer of General \nMills, or for serving at our request as a director or officer or another position at another corporation or enterprise, as the case may be. \nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws also provide that we must indemnify and advance reasonable expenses to our directors \nand officers, subject to our receipt of an undertaking from the indemnified party as may be required under the DGCL. Our By-laws \nexpressly authorize us to carry directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance to protect General Mills, our directors, officers and certain employees \nfor some liabilities.\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may discourage \nstockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of \nreducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might \notherwise benefit us and our stockholders. However, these provisions do not limit or eliminate our rights, or those of any stockholder, \nto seek non-monetary relief such as injunction or rescission in the event of a breach of a director\u2019s duty of care. The provisions do not \nalter the liability of directors under the federal securities laws. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent \nthat, in a class action or direct suit, we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these \nindemnification provisions. There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding against any of our directors, officers or \nemployees for which indemnification is sought.\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares\nOur authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock and preference stock will be available for future issuance without \napproval by the holders of Common Stock. We may use additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public \nofferings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares \nof Common Stock and preference stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a \nproxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock is EQ Shareowner Services.\nListing\nOur Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cGIS.\u201d\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\nThe following description of our debt securities is a summary and does not purport to be complete.

In addition, our Certificate \nof Incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, each having three-year staggered terms.

Vacancies on the Board of Directors and newly created directorships \nresulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled only by a majority vote of the remaining directors then \nin office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. These provisions prevent stockholders from removing incumbent \ndirectors without cause and filling the resulting vacancies with their own nominees.\nSpecial Meetings; Stockholder Action by Written Consent\nUnder our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, stockholders may call a special meeting of stockholders only upon the \nwritten request of holders of record of not less than 25 percent of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. Our Certificate of \nIncorporation prohibits stockholder action by written consent. These provisions limit the ability of a stockholder or group of \nstockholders to take immediate action to gain control of the Board of Directors or otherwise initiate direct action.\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations\nOur By-laws contain advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals related to the nomination of candidates \nfor election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of \nstockholder proposals related to stockholder nominations for the election of directors or new business must be received at our principal \nexecutive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the \npreceding year. The notice must contain the information required by the By-laws. These provisions may have the effect of precluding \nthe conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed. These provisions may also discourage or deter \na potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to \nobtain control of the Company.\nNo Cumulative Voting\nUnder Delaware law, the right to vote cumulatively does not exist unless the certificate of incorporation specifically authorizes \ncumulative voting. Our Certificate of Incorporation does not grant stockholders the right to vote cumulatively.\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares\nThe authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock and preference stock are available for future issuance without \nstockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to \nraise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of Common \nStock and preference stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of General Mills by means of a proxy \ncontest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

This suggests JnJ relied more on volume rather than price increases to drive growth.\n\n- Operating profit margins declined from 24.3% in FY2021 to 22.9% in FY2022, suggesting some pressure on profitability. \n\n- R&D expense as a % of sales declined from 15.7% in FY2021 to 15.4% in FY2022, indicating lower investment in innovation\/growth initiatives.\n\n- The growth was driven mainly by the Oncology and Immunology segments within Pharmaceuticals.

The strengthening of the US dollar negatively impacted international sales and gross margin for Pharmaceuticals. \n\n- These negative impacts were partially offset by:\n\n- Supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment that helped improve gross margin.\n\nSo in summary, the main drivers of gross margin decline were one-time vaccine manufacturing exit costs and currency headwinds, partially offset by supply chain improvements in Consumer Health. The vaccine costs and currency impacts specifically hurt Pharmaceuticals gross margin. \n\nThe filing does not indicate that gross margin is not a useful metric for JnJ. As a diversified healthcare company, gross margin remains an important profitability indicator for JnJ along with other metrics like operating margin. There is no indication that gross margin has become less relevant for JnJ compared to prior years. The decline was driven by specific one-time and macroeconomic factors, not a change in the usefulness of the metric itself.","label":"Correct Answer"}

However, based on the information provided, it does not seem meaningful to calculate inventory turnover for JnJ. The company operates in three diverse business segments (Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical, and MedTech) with different inventory needs and turnover rates. \n\n- Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.\n- Inventory turnover ratio cannot be meaningfully calculated for JnJ as a whole based on the information provided. The company does not break out cost of goods sold or inventory values by segment to enable segment-level turnover calculations. Additionally, the three business segments likely have very different inventory needs and turnover rates, so a consolidated turnover ratio would not provide useful information about inventory management. \n\n- The Pharmaceutical segment requires specialized manufacturing, storage and distribution of drugs and maintains safety stock to ensure constant supply. The MedTech segment produces medical devices and surgical equipment which can have long lead times. The Consumer Health segment sells consumer products which likely have faster turnover.\n\n- Due to the diversity of JnJ's business segments, consolidated inventory turnover would blend together numbers that are not comparable. Therefore, conventional inventory turnover ratio analysis is not very meaningful for understanding JnJ's overall inventory management. More segment-level detail would be needed for useful inventory turnover analysis.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

The expected life assumptions were based on the\nsimplified method prescribed by accounting guidance for stock-based compensation due to limited historical exercise data.

The following description is a summary and does not purport to be complete. We encourage you\nto read our Articles of Incorporation and our By-Laws, which we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as\nwell as the applicable provisions of the NCBCA.\nGeneral\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 3,600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value one and two-thirds\ncents (1-2\/3 cents) per share. As of February 3, 2022 there were 1,383,451,400 shares of common stock outstanding which were\nheld of record by approximately 101,778 shareholders.\nVoting Rights. Each holder of a share of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a\nvote of shareholders. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of common stock vote together as a single class on all matters\nsubmitted to a vote of shareholders. Directors are elected by a majority vote in an uncontested election and by a plurality vote in\na contested election. A majority of the votes cast means the number of shares voted \u201cfor\u201d a director exceeds the number of votes\ncast \u201cagainst\u201d that director.\nDividend Rights. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by\nour Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, subject to any preferential dividend rights\ngranted to the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\nLiquidation Rights. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, holders of\nour common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of creditors and subject to prior distribution\nrights of preferred stock then outstanding.\nPreemptive and Other Rights. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive, conversion or redemption rights. Shares\nof our common stock are not subject to further calls or assessments by us. The rights of holders of our common stock are subject\nto the powers of our Board of Directors to declare and pay dividends as described above. Except as described under \u201cAntiTakeover Provisions\u201d below, there are no restrictions on the repurchase or redemption of shares by us while there is any arrearage\nin the payment of dividends or sinking fund installments. All shares of our common stock presently outstanding are fully paid\nand non-assessable.\nListing. Our common stock is listed and traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cPEP.\u201d Our\ncommon stock is also listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, as well as the NCBCA, contain certain provisions that could have an antitakeover effect. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our\nBoard of Directors and in the policies formulated by our Board of Directors and to discourage certain types of transactions which\nmay involve an actual or threatened change of control of us. The provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an\nunsolicited proposal for a takeover of us that does not contemplate the acquisition of all of our outstanding shares or an\nunsolicited proposal for the restructuring or sale of all or part of us.\n2\n\nSet forth below is a description of the relevant provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and the NCBCA.\nThe description is intended as a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Articles of Incorporation and By-\nLaws, copies of which are filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this\nExhibit 4.72 is a part, and to the provisions of the NCBCA.\nNumber of Directors; Removal; Filling Vacancies. The NCBCA provides that the number of directors may be\nestablished by the by-laws, but the number may not be less than three. Our Articles of Incorporation provide that the number of\ndirectors shall not be less than three nor more than 20 directors, with the exact number to be fixed from time to time by a\nresolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board of Directors. Our Articles of Incorporation previously provided for three\nclasses of directors, but this provision was eliminated by an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation that became effective on\nMay 1, 2019.\nUnder the NCBCA, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, directors may be removed with or without\ncause, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors. Our Articles of Incorporation\ndo not change the provisions of the NCBCA.\nOur Articles of Incorporation provide that any vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors, including a vacancy resulting\nfrom the removal of a director or an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by the affirmative vote of the majority of\nthe remaining directors even if less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. The By-Laws permit a vacancy to be filled by the\nshareholders, if the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the Board of Directors.\nThese provisions could have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to\nobtain control of us, because the incumbency of directors could not be changed at a single annual meeting.\nNo Shareholder Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings. The NCBCA provides that, unless provided otherwise in\nthe articles of incorporation, action required or permitted to be taken at a shareholders\u2019 meeting may be taken without a meeting\nonly by unanimous written consent signed by all shareholders entitled to vote on the action. Our Articles of Incorporation\nexpressly deny this right of action by written consent. The NCBCA also provides that special meetings of the shareholders shall\nbe held when directed by the board of directors, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer or the president, or when\nrequested in writing by the holders of not less than 10% of all the shares entitled to vote on any issue proposed to be considered at\nthe meeting. A special meeting may not be called by any other person. Our Articles of Incorporation expressly deny the ability of\nshareholders to call a special meeting.\nThese provisions could have the effect of delaying until the next annual shareholders\u2019 meeting shareholder actions which\nare favored by the holders of less than a majority of our outstanding shares, because a shareholder could not force shareholder\nconsideration of such acts between annual meetings.\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our By-Laws establish an advance\nnotice procedure for shareholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an\nannual meeting of our shareholders.\nThe By-Laws provide that any shareholder wishing to nominate persons for election as directors at, or bring other business\nbefore, an annual meeting must deliver to our secretary a written notice of the shareholder\u2019s intention to do so. To be timely, the\nshareholder\u2019s notice must be delivered to us not later than the 90th day nor earlier than the 120th day prior to the first anniversary\nof the preceding year\u2019s annual meeting. If the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after\nsuch anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and\nnot later than the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public\nannouncement of the date of such meeting is first made by us. The notice must set forth:\n3\n\n\u2022\n\nthe name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and the beneficial owner, if any, on\nwhose behalf the nomination is made;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe name, age, business address and, if known, residence address of each person so proposed;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe principal occupation or employment of each person so proposed for the past five years;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe number of shares of capital stock of PepsiCo beneficially owned within the meaning of SEC Rule 13d-1 by each\nperson so proposed;\n\n\u2022\n\nany other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of\ndirectors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d);\n\n\u2022\n\nas to the shareholder giving the notice, (i) the name and address, as they appear on our books, of such shareholder and\nany other shareholders known by such shareholder to be supporting such nominees and (ii) the class and number of\nshares of our capital stock which are beneficially owned by such shareholder and any other shareholders known by\nsuch shareholder to be supporting such nominees on the date of such shareholder notice; and\n\n\u2022\n\na representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of our stock entitled to vote at such meeting and that the\nshareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the\nnotice.\n\nTo be in proper form, a shareholder\u2019s notice relating to an item of business","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

Organic revenue growth was 14%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n- Operating profit grew 3% to $11.5 billion, while operating margin declined 0.7 percentage points to 13.3%. Operating profit reflected net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by higher operating costs, a 42-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, and impairment charges.\n\n- Net income attributable to PepsiCo grew 17% to $8.9 billion, reflecting operating profit growth and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. \n\n- Diluted EPS grew 17% to $6.42, reflecting net income growth.\n\n- In Q1, PepsiCo completed the sale of its Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in the newly formed joint venture called Tropicana Brands Group (TBG). The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $3.3 billion.\n\n- PepsiCo continued to experience significantly higher costs, including transportation, labor, commodities, and packaging. These inflationary pressures impacted results and are expected to continue in 2023.\n\n- The company incurred $1.4 billion of pre-tax charges related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including impairments of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.\n\n- PepsiCo returned $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2022 through dividends ($6.2 billion) and share repurchases ($1.5 billion). \n\n- In February 2023, PepsiCo announced a 10% increase in its annualized dividend to $5.06 per share and expects to return approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2023.\n\nIn summary, PepsiCo delivered solid operating performance in 2022 despite a challenging inflationary environment and geopolitical volatility. The company gained market share in beverages and grew earnings per share.

The company benefited from effective net pricing actions and strong organic revenue growth of 14%, which helped offset significant inflationary pressures on costs as well as unfavorable foreign exchange.\n\n- The company generated $10.8 billion of operating cash flow and $5.9 billion of free cash flow in 2022. This enabled PepsiCo to return $7.7 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases for the full year. \n\n- PepsiCo has a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. As of December 31, 2022, the company had $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $39 billion in long-term debt, and access to $7.6 billion in revolving credit facilities. \n\n- PepsiCo's return on invested capital was 17% in 2022, reflecting its ability to generate solid returns even in a high inflationary environment.\n\n- The company expects to return approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders again in 2023, comprising dividends of $6.7 billion and share repurchases of $1 billion.\n\n- PepsiCo faces risks related to continued inflationary pressures, foreign exchange volatility, the conflict in Ukraine, and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. However, the company has demonstrated resilience through its pricing power, portfolio of strong brands, and geographic diversification.\n\nIn summary, PepsiCo continues to deliver solid operating results and cash flows, maintain a strong financial position, and return significant cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks despite a challenging operating environment.

The increase was mainly due to higher revenues, primarily from Comirnaty sales. \n\n- The tax provision was $1.9 billion, compared to $370 million in 2020. The effective tax rate was 7.6% in 2021, up from 5.3% in 2020.\n\n- The higher tax rate in 2021 was primarily due to the change in jurisdictional mix of earnings related to Comirnaty sales, as well as lower tax benefits from intangible asset impairments. \n\n- Pfizer continues to pay its estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act over 8 years through 2026. The third installment was paid in 2021 and the fourth is due in April 2022.\n\n- Pfizer has gross unrecognized tax benefits of $6.1 billion, excluding interest, primarily related to transfer pricing, certain tax credits and deductions, and state and international tax contingencies. \n\n- The company expects to resolve a number of tax audits and court decisions in the next 12 months that could potentially impact the unrecognized tax benefits balance.\n\nIn summary, Pfizer's tax provision and effective tax rate increased in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly driven by the change in mix of jurisdictional earnings related to Comirnaty sales. The company continues to make installment payments on its repatriation tax liability and has significant unrecognized tax benefits that could impact results in future periods.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

This is the default tax rate set by law that applies to taxable income. \n\n- Pfizer's effective tax rate was 7.6% in 2021, 5.3% in 2020, and 5.2% in 2019. The effective tax rate represents the average rate at which Pfizer's pre-tax income from continuing operations was actually taxed.\n\n- The difference between the statutory rate and effective rate is explained by various factors that increase or decrease the tax expense relative to pre-tax income.\n\n- Key factors that decreased the tax expense and effective tax rate versus the statutory rate:\n\n1) Tax benefits related to acquisitions and internal restructuring - These reduced the tax rate by 3.4% in 2021, 13.5% in 2020, and 9.3% in 2019. They relate to reorganizations of legal entities and acquisitions.\n\n2) Tax benefits on dividends and other income earned abroad - These reduced the rate by 2.9% in 2021 and 1.2% in 2020. They relate to income earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. \n\n3) Tax credits and incentives - These reduced the rate by 1.7% in 2021, 2.2% in 2020, and 1.3% in 2019. They include R&D credits and state and local incentives.\n\n4) Resolution of certain tax positions - These reduced the rate by 12.4% in 2019, relating to the favorable settlement of an IRS audit. \n\n- Key factors that increased the tax expense and effective tax rate versus the statutory rate:\n\n1) Tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) - This increased the rate by 2.2% in 2021 and 2.0% in 2020. It relates to income earned by foreign subsidiaries.\n\n2) Other net unfavorable adjustments - These increased the rate by 2.3% in 2021, 1.4% in 2020, and 1.2% in 2019. They represent miscellaneous smaller adjusting items.\n\nSo in summary, the effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax benefits and costs related to Pfizer's global operations and transactions.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased 5% operationally. \n\n- Income from continuing operations before tax decreased to $2.3 billion from $11.4 billion, primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling, informational and administrative expenses, partially offset by gains on equity securities versus losses last year.\n\n- GAAP diluted EPS decreased to $0.41 from $1.73. Adjusted diluted EPS decreased to $0.67 from $2.04.\n\n- The company tightened its 2023 revenue guidance range to $67-$70 billion from the previous range of $67-$71 billion. This reflects an expected 31% operational decline at the midpoint compared to 2022, primarily due to reduced sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid. \n\n- Comirnaty revenues decreased 82% operationally to $1.5 billion. Paxlovid revenues decreased 98% operationally to $143 million. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues grew 5% operationally.\n\n- Key growth drivers included Vyndaqel, Eliquis, Xtandi, Inlyta and newly acquired products Nurtec ODT and Oxbryta. \n\n- The company continues to advance its pipeline, including regulatory submissions for its Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine and oral antiviral Paxlovid in younger populations.\n\nIn summary, Pfizer's financial performance declined significantly in Q2 due to reduced COVID-19 product sales, but the business excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid showed operational growth. The company tightened its 2023 revenue outlook reflecting continued expected declines in COVID-19 products. Pipeline advancements continue.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased 5% operationally. \n\n- Net income attributable to Pfizer decreased 76% to $2.3 billion.\n\n- Diluted EPS decreased 76% to $0.41. \n\n- The company tightened its full-year 2022 revenue guidance range to $67-$70 billion from the previous range of $98-$102 billion. The lowered guidance reflects expected declines in sales of COVID-19 products.\n\n- Pfizer announced plans to acquire Seagen for $43 billion in cash. The acquisition is expected to close in late 2023\/early 2024.\n\nSome key takeaways:\n\n- As expected, Pfizer saw a substantial revenue decline compared to last year when COVID-19 product sales were much higher. Excluding COVID-19 products, Pfizer's revenues showed modest growth driven by drugs like Vyndaqel, Eliquis and Xtandi.\n\n- The Seagen acquisition demonstrates Pfizer's strategy to augment growth through M&A. Seagen strengthens Pfizer's oncology portfolio.\n\n- Pfizer lowered its 2022 revenue outlook mainly due to reduced expectations for Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales as demand trends downward. However, Pfizer expects its non-COVID business will deliver operational growth.\n\n- Pfizer's diverse portfolio, pipeline and strong cash flows should help offset the eventual decline of COVID-19 product revenues. But the speed and extent of decline remains a risk.\n\nIn summary, Pfizer delivered weaker Q2 results mostly attributed to waning COVID-19 product sales. But its base business showed resilience. The Seagen deal boosts Pfizer's long-term growth potential. However, near-term results will continue facing tough comparisons to 2021's COVID-driven sales surge.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

The filing states that SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased in FY2023 \"primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales\". This indicates that the higher sales volume allowed Ulta to spend less on marketing and incentives as a percentage of sales.\n\n- Deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments. The filing mentions there was deleverage in this area due to wage investments, meaning payroll costs increased faster than sales.\n\n- Deleverage in corporate overhead due to strategic investments. The filing states there was deleverage in corporate overhead, likely indicating that investments in strategic initiatives at the corporate level led to overhead costs rising faster than sales. \n\nIn summary, the key drivers seem to be 1) Leverage of marketing and incentives 2) Rise in store payroll\/benefits and 3) Increase in corporate overhead investments.

{"financebench_id":"financebench_id_00215","model_name":"claude-2","eval_mode":"inContext","temp":0.01,"question":"Is Verizon a capital intensive business based on FY 2022 data?","gold_answer":"Yes. Verizon's capital intensity ratio was approximately 2.774729. This means that it took approximately $2.77 of assets to generate $1 of revenue and thus, Verizon can be considered capital intensive.","model_answer":" Here are the key points on Verizon's employee benefit plans and critical accounting estimates related to valuing these plans:\n\n- Verizon maintains defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care and life insurance plans for certain employees. At the end of 2022, Verizon's pension plans were underfunded by $1.6 billion and its postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by $10.7 billion. \n\n- Accounting for these plans involves significant estimates around the benefit obligations, which depend on actuarial assumptions like discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the funded status of the plans and net periodic benefit cost\/income.\n\n- In 2022, Verizon recorded a $7 billion actuarial gain primarily due to increasing the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations from 2.9% at the end of 2021 to 5.2% at the end of 2022. This reduced the projected benefit obligations and caused a corresponding decrease in other comprehensive income.\n\n- The expected return on plan assets assumption is 6.7% for pension plans and 4.9% for other postretirement plans in 2022. Lower than expected returns could increase net periodic benefit costs in future years.\n\n- The discount rate is determined annually based on interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds. A lower discount rate increases benefit obligations and net periodic costs.\n\n- Healthcare cost trend rates are assumed to be 6.6% next year, declining gradually to 4.5% by 2031. Higher trend rates increase postretirement benefit costs.\n\n- Pension and postretirement benefits accounting requires significant judgment in determining actuarial assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on Verizon's financial statements.","label":"Incorrect Answer"}

It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.","model_answer":" Here are the key points on Verizon's pension and postretirement benefit plans based on the information provided:\n\n- Verizon maintains defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care and life insurance plans for certain employees. \n\n- At December 31, 2022, Verizon's aggregate defined benefit pension obligation was $15.3 billion and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $13.7 billion, resulting in an unfunded pension obligation of $1.6 billion.\n\n- The other postretirement benefits obligation was approximately $11.1 billion at December 31, 2022. \n\n- Net periodic benefit cost for pensions was $1.3 billion in 2022 compared to a net periodic benefit income of $1.9 billion in 2021. The change was primarily due to a net remeasurement loss in 2022 compared to a net remeasurement gain in 2021, driven by changes in discount rate and return on plan asset assumptions. \n\n- Net periodic benefit income for other postretirement benefits was $3.3 billion in 2022 compared to $1.5 billion in 2021. The change was primarily due to a larger net remeasurement gain in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\n- Key assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31, 2022 include a weighted-average discount rate of 5.2% and expected return on plan assets of 6.7% for pension plans.\n\n- Plan assets for pension plans were $13.7 billion at December 31, 2022, with 41-51% of assets expected to achieve a return in excess of liability growth and 55-65% invested as liability hedging assets. \n\n- Verizon expects to make approximately $200 million of discretionary pension contributions and $820 million of postretirement benefit payments in 2023.\n\nSo in summary, Verizon has significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations, but net periodic benefit cost\/income can fluctuate significantly based on actuarial assumptions like discount rates and asset returns.

Its total debt decreased slightly from $150.9 billion at the end of 2021 to $150.6 billion. \n\n- In 2022, Verizon received $17.8 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings and used $13.6 billion to repay, redeem and repurchase long-term debt. It continues to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. \n\n- Net cash provided by operating activities was $37.1 billion in 2022, a decrease from $39.5 billion in 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by higher device payment receivables.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $23.1 billion in 2022 compared to $20.3 billion in 2021, primarily due to accelerated 5G network deployment. \n\n- Verizon contributed $53 million to its nonqualified pension plans and made no discretionary contributions to its qualified pension plan in 2022.
