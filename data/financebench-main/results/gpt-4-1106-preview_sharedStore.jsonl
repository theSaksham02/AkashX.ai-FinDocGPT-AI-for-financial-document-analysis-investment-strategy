Additionally, there is a mention of services gross margin changes and factors affecting future gross margins, but these are not explicitly linked to American Express.\n\nGross margin is typically a useful metric for companies that sell goods because it measures the difference between revenue from goods sold and the cost of those goods. However, for a company like American Express, which primarily provides financial services, gross margin may not be the most relevant metric. Instead, financial service companies often focus on metrics such as net interest margin, return on equity, or net income to assess financial performance. These metrics are more relevant to the business model of a financial services company, which earns money through interest, fees, and other financial services rather than selling physical goods.\n\nSince the context does not provide information about American Express's gross margin changes for FY2022, I cannot provide a specific answer to the question about what drove the gross margin change for American Express in that fiscal year.","label":"Refusal"}

Reported Sales: J&J's reported sales for the full year 2022 were $94,943 million, which is only a 1.3% increase from the $93,775 million reported in 2021. This modest increase does not indicate high growth, which would typically be represented by a significantly higher percentage increase year over year.\n\n2. Net Earnings: The company's net earnings decreased by 14.1%, from $20,878 million in 2021 to $17,941 million in 2022. A decline in net earnings is contrary to what would be expected from a high growth company.\n\n3.

Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Please utilize information provided primarily within the statement of cash flows and the statement of income.","gold_answer":0.079,"model_answer":"To calculate the three-year average of capital expenditures (capex) as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts for the fiscal years 2018 to 2020, we need to find the total capex for those years and the total revenue for the same period. Then we will divide the total capex by the total revenue and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. Finally, we will average this percentage over the three years.\n\nFrom the provided information, we have the following capex for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020:\n\n2018: $1,486,843 (in thousands)\n2019: $1,864,082 (in thousands)\n2020: $2,262,473 (in thousands)\n\nTotal capex for 2018-2020 = $1,486,843k + $1,864,082k + $2,262,473k\n\nNow, we need the revenue for the same years. However, the revenue figures for 2018, 2019, and 2020 are not provided in the information given. Without the revenue figures, we cannot calculate the capex as a percentage of revenue or the three-year average of this percentage.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I cannot calculate the FY2018 - FY2020 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts.
